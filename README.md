```zsh
➜ ~ about
Full-stack developer building tools that *actually* work.
I craft APIs like handmade pasta – clean, robust, and served with just the right amount of spice.
Typescript in the frontend, Django or Node in the back, crying softly in the middle.
Currently wrestling with NestJS and pretending to understand dependency injection.
